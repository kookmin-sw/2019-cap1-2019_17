The evaluators are also quick to dismiss their accomplishments question 3, can I date someone who reports to me still?"},{"time":"02:04.07","transcript":" Big know you may not feel like you're really in the boss.

So try to make it clear to your co-workers that you're not the same person you love each other but you are going to disagree question 5, why are co-workers often attracted to each other?

So I imagine you have a big group project with a tight deadline and you're working late nights and brainstorming ideas.

But how do I help create a workplace climate and culture where people feel respected for their individual contributions not for their appearance or their gender or their personal relationships. So the larger question is, how do you make sure people are valued and respected?"}]}
