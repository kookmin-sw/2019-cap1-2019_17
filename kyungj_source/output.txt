I've been doing this job for quite some time now 60 years and I like to think I'm a pretty good boss. You absolutely are important to me that everyone here on the crew cuz we work with a big crew. It's important to me that they're happy and I'm always looking for ways to improve things here make a little better. So this morning I put out a complaint box backstage just to kind of check it out. Yeah, and I can maybe try and fix it and all of these are from one day and it's just really a little troubling. Let's check out the some of the issues are okay was interesting. It says here first card. We need a better nut spoon.
Not spoon. Spoon. That's weird.
 The nut spoon situation is unacceptable.
 What what is a nuts? I don't know. It's his crazy. True words not spoon. Oh my God. Can someone please tell me what a nut spoon is be able to clear this up. Okay, this is Tony our camera guy Tony. Yeah. Tell me tell us what is the entire cruise existence?
 Okay, Johnny, that seems a little extreme.
 OK Google
 Okay, so here's the deal with enough spoon.
 There's a snack table backstage right with a crew gets their snacks that make sense. Sometimes it's cashews sometimes is pistachios. Sometimes it's honey roasted peanuts. Sometimes it's a mix of different kinds of nuts or what we on the crew call. Okay, you know what we get. It just tell me about the nuts. So when the crow want some nuts to snack on instead we use a spoon to scoop up the nuts and it will transfer the nuts from the spoon to this spoon Conan.

 Okay. Now here's where the story maintains the same level of interesting myths.
 Spooning question is it's a small plastic teaspoon.
 Okay, Tony. Why do you have a plastic teaspoon on you? I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
